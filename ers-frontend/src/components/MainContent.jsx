            <p align="justify">Expense reimbursement is a critical component of business finance. All firms must keep track of their cash and reimburse employees for their expenses. From time to time, the employees of any organization incur expenses in order to keep the business running, ranging from travel and entertainment expenses to office supplies.</p>
            <p align="justify">An expense reimbursement is the payment made from your business to an employee for business-related expenses they have incurred personally. The reimbursement amount should exactly match the amount of the expense. The process of reporting, submitting, approving, reimbursing, and auditing employee-initiated business expenses is called expense management.</p>
